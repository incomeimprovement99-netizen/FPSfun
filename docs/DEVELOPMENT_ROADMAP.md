# Development Roadmap

Ordered, newest at the bottom. Status: ✅ shipped / 🚧 in progress / ⏭ planned.

One milestone per shipped feature or batch. Each round of work has a plan and a
results doc; from Phase 11 on they are `PHASE_N_PLAN_*.md` and `PHASE_N_*.md`.
Milestones 1 to 10 were written after the fact from the earlier rounds'
`PLAN_*` / `RESULTS_*` docs (which keep their names) and the git history.

## Milestone 1 — The look pass and the movement pass ✅
2026-09-13. Colour grade (split tone, S-curve, vignette, grain), a re-light, an authored sky dome, bevelled
structure, one palette; all 27 weapons modelled in seven families; gloved first-person hands; bolt, slide,
pump and cylinder cycling, muzzle flash, brass, reloads with the support hand; the jointed training robot
over invisible, unchanged hit zones. Movement: wall climb, tap-strafe lurch, downhill slides, landing dip.
See [`PLAN_LOOK_AND_FEEL.md`](./PLAN_LOOK_AND_FEEL.md), [`RESULTS_LOOK_AND_FEEL.md`](./RESULTS_LOOK_AND_FEEL.md),
[`MOVEMENT_AUDIT.md`](./MOVEMENT_AUDIT.md).

## Milestone 2 — Snappy, the Apex HUD, and The Run ✅
2026-09-13. Measured the frame rate (833 fps Competitive; the display is the cap) and explained it in
Settings; the HUD laid out where Apex puts it (minimap, compass, vitals, weapons, damage numbers); the
first movement course, THE RUN, with a timer, pop-ups and ranks; the course pistols.
See [`PLAN_SNAPPY_HUD_COURSE.md`](./PLAN_SNAPPY_HUD_COURSE.md), [`RESULTS_SNAPPY_HUD_COURSE.md`](./RESULTS_SNAPPY_HUD_COURSE.md).

## Milestone 3 — Ziplines, ladders, sights ✅
2026-09-13. Ziplines with the Movement Wiki's rules; ladders; interact prompts; the course moved behind a lit
gate; ten optics with housings and reticles, full-screen scopes from 3x; static meshes merged; raw mouse
input; scroll binds; hipfire-only crosshair.
See [`PLAN_ZIPLINES_LADDERS_SIGHTS.md`](./PLAN_ZIPLINES_LADDERS_SIGHTS.md), [`RESULTS_ZIPLINES_LADDERS_SIGHTS.md`](./RESULTS_ZIPLINES_LADDERS_SIGHTS.md).

## Milestone 4 — Wall tech, the tech feed, splits and a ghost ✅
2026-09-13. Climb-zone wall jumps (mini-bounce, wallbounce, wall push); the practice wall; the tech feed
that names every superglide, wallbounce and lurch and says why a miss missed; course splits and a ghost;
variable zooms; Digital Threat optics.
See [`PLAN_WALLTECH_SPLITS_GHOST.md`](./PLAN_WALLTECH_SPLITS_GHOST.md), [`RESULTS_WALLTECH_SPLITS_GHOST.md`](./RESULTS_WALLTECH_SPLITS_GHOST.md).

## Milestone 5 — 1v1 by code, loadouts, menus, the beta build ✅
2026-09-14. PeerJS 1v1 with a match code, shooter-decided hits, rounds and the circle; five default and
five custom loadouts, operators, heirlooms; the tabbed menu; the public beta build with codenames; a
24-finding bug hunt.
See [`PLAN_1V1_BETA.md`](./PLAN_1V1_BETA.md), [`RESULTS_1V1_BETA.md`](./RESULTS_1V1_BETA.md).

## Milestone 6 — Two courses, bots, 1v1v1, stats ✅
2026-09-14 (first commit `2ddccd7`). The Run: Advanced; the course engine; arena bots at three
difficulties; 1v1v1 on a star network; the profile and the Stats tab; the leaderboard worker (not
deployed).
See [`PLAN_BOTS_TRIPLES_STATS.md`](./PLAN_BOTS_TRIPLES_STATS.md), [`RESULTS_BOTS_TRIPLES_STATS.md`](./RESULTS_BOTS_TRIPLES_STATS.md).

## Milestone 7 — Controller, the wallbounce and slide from the wiki, hands and gun animations ✅
2026-09-14 (`da7e52c`). Gamepad play (Start, look curves, deadzone, auto sprint, rumble); three movement
numbers corrected against the wiki's pages (the sprint start, the slide, the wallbounce's slide-jump
recipe); rebuilt hands; draw, holster, idle, slide and sprint gun poses; kill feed and nameplates.
See [`PLAN_FEEL_CONTROLLER.md`](./PLAN_FEEL_CONTROLLER.md), [`RESULTS_FEEL_CONTROLLER.md`](./RESULTS_FEEL_CONTROLLER.md).

## Milestone 8 — Polish, the last bug hunt, the ship ✅
2026-09-14 (`0e20ca2`). Bigger signs, more animations, fourteen findings fixed, the deploy steps; live on
GitHub Pages.
See [`RESULTS_POLISH_SHIP.md`](./RESULTS_POLISH_SHIP.md), [`DEPLOY_GUIDE.md`](./DEPLOY_GUIDE.md).

## Milestone 9 — Our own server, the full bug hunt, aim assist, rebinding, invite links ✅
2026-09-15 (`fb81124`). `server/game/` (our PeerJS broker, a TURN relay, online boards, one-command deploy
to a free Oracle VM, not live yet: waiting on the VM); 31 findings fixed; controller aim assist; the
Controls tab; invite links; the first-visit welcome and device check.
See [`RESULTS_SERVER_HUNT.md`](./RESULTS_SERVER_HUNT.md), [`SERVER_GUIDE.md`](./SERVER_GUIDE.md).

## Milestone 10 — The lobby, animated figures, third person, the battle royale, the squad ✅
2026-09-15 (`c92a2d2`, `bd1873b`, `1eaf029`). Create match puts you in the arena; jointed figures posed
from stance and speed, sent over the network; third person with an orbit; the gap analysis; Outskirts (a
middle POI and four outer ones), the ring with Apex's six rounds, the drop shown on the map, healing, the
placement card; a squad of up to three against the bots over the same links.
See [`RESULTS_BR.md`](./RESULTS_BR.md), [`GAP_ANALYSIS.md`](./GAP_ANALYSIS.md), [`NEXT_STEPS.md`](./NEXT_STEPS.md).

## Milestone 11 — Phase 11 planned: the roadmap, the phase plan, the research ✅
2026-09-15. The docs pattern switches to phases and milestones. The plan for abilities (JOLT, TRIAGE),
the killcam and death recap, and every gap-analysis next step short of PvP BR, in thirteen workstreams.
Current Apex numbers with sources for the rest of the phase (heals, shields, knockdowns, throwables,
Nemesis, Bocek, the Season 30 energy-ammo regen, Gun Run).
See [`PHASE_11_PLAN_ABILITIES_KILLCAM_AND_THE_AAA_BATCH.md`](./PHASE_11_PLAN_ABILITIES_KILLCAM_AND_THE_AAA_BATCH.md),
[`RESEARCH_PHASE_11.md`](./RESEARCH_PHASE_11.md).

## Milestone 12 — Abilities: JOLT and TRIAGE ✅
2026-09-15 (Phase 11B).
- **JOLT**: a 10 m dash the way you are moving (forward with no keys), level, over 0.18 s, walls stop it,
  out at sprint speed; 3 s cooldown; key F (LB on a pad). **TRIAGE**: every heal item twice as fast.
  Numbers in `src/config/abilities.json`; the dash is `Player.jolt` in the movement code.
- **The choice card**: "CHOOSE YOUR ABILITY [5] JOLT [6] TRIAGE" when one becomes available: on landing in
  a battle royale, at each countdown of an arena or bot match (d-pad left and right on a pad); one line in
  the range, where 5 and 6 pick one to practise any time. The HUD slot shows the key and the cooldown.
- **The option**: "Abilities on / off" for the friends' matches, the bot match and the BR (on by default),
  remembered per kind; the host's setting rides in the welcome. Bots take one at random: a JOLT bot dodges
  sideways when hit, a TRIAGE bot heals faster; every bot now heals when nobody is in its sights for 4 s.
- **Everyone sees it**: a JOLT sends an effect to the others (a streak and a whoosh); bots' too.
- Keys moved: reset dummies F to Y. Heal items moved to `src/config/items.json`.
- Tests: movesim (10.00 m in 0.18 s, the wall, level in the air, the drop refuses it), verify (cooldown,
  TRIAGE scale), e2e (off by default in bots; the card at the countdown; JOLT moves you and starts the
  cooldown; the BR card on landing; TRIAGE halves the cell; a squad guest's JOLT reaches the host);
  `tools/snap.ts` screenshots the HUD states.
